do a deep web research to gather mathematical tricks, rules and approaches to predict future of a market asset, pair, or token. use as many parameters as you can gather. pick from the pairs that can be traded on pionex, Futures six canditates, that swing most. I need those, that occasionally multiply the price 10 fold. and those that drop or rise most often with greatest percentual steps. render the small but most detailed graph for each, showing swithable view for the: last minute window, 13 minutes, 29 minutes, 229 minutes, and 997 minutes, and non linear display, showing the whole history of the asset or pair starting with largest time window, but shortening according to the golden ratio to show the one minute time interval stretched in the right half of the chart. use darker coloring for older candles. show the actual prediction as a dashed line that is continuing to the right from the curent time within the limits of the future developement that the prediction line should not escape. it should definetelly stay within the boundaries. if not, there is something wrong with the prediction and it should be adjusted to get mor precise. keep the prediction line rendered from the time the predicting has started. let the chart display timestamp of the spot that the mouse is pointing on upon hovering over the graph. the prediction parameters should be constantly perfecting and re-adjusting using the tracking of the previous prediction data and it's accuracy. display the current predicton accuracy and the set parameters of the prediction in an expandable/collapsible section for each rendered graph. Also find any free online services, that do the same, trying to predict the graph. where relevant, show their prediction and accuracy in different color. we need to predict the turnovers, render a small arrow down above highs and arrow up under the lows. in past and future. show the frequency or a mathematical approach that most closely expresses the frequency. evaluate the accuracy of prediction of highs and lows as well. also use fractal pattern recognition to notice graphically similar patterns repeating, even throughout different scales. the pattern recognition can also help predict the future graph evolution. Use MACD, RSI, StochRsi, ATR and other markers for the prediction as well. Also include comparation with graphs that resemble each other - where one follows other. for example when bitcoin moves, many other cryptocurrencies follow, thus can be predicted.


Connect to the Pionex API directly - there is a public stream that needs no registration
-we need the real-time auto-updating, you can periodically call the pionex public stream and any other sources that have no registration needed for api access.
-the correlation with other assets analysis will be started per asset on demand. also the user must be able to pause, and stop any analysis per asset. on the bottom of the page show expandable/collapsible detailed debug console and the stats with used memory, cpu time, and the numbers of parameters being watched, compared, and analysed simultaneousely.
-find some external prediction services, that might work, list lnks to others - preferrably direct links to chart and prediction data for the same assets.
-start with frequency analysis switched of, but allow user to initiate it
Let's create the the whole final project with all the features fully implemented.  keep updating the notes with the plan for yourself to enable continuation in a different chat.
